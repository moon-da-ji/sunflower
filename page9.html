        <h1><span class="highlight">A SAD IN MY LIFE</span></h1>
        <p>There is no exception in this world, all of us can go bye. We live in the same air, places with differents kinds of people, surroundings and traditions. But the only one that we have in common is we have our own family.</p>
        <p>A family that makes our life complete, through them we feel the true love, care that we are begging to someone whose not 100% care for us.</p>
        <p>But one thing that i know, not all family can make you feel that you're loved or they loved you, because some of them are just pretending to you that they love you, but inside they are just pursing themeselves to accept you, just to avoid the situition or event in the past.</p>
        <p>Saying goodbye to someone or one of your family is really hard. For me, that time, is not just a goodbye but i'm not that powerful to make decision of what i want, so i'm just here in the dark room, cry'n and mesmerizing the event that already done years ago. Suffering the pain that i feel that time are still in me inside. Hoping that someday you"ll back, smilling, sending me to school, having some future talks. I always hoping that you'll back with healthy body but i know you'll never be back again, i'm just dreaming and hopeless this time becuase until now i really don't understand why do you need to leave?</p>
        <p>So here I am fighting to the future that you left to me!</p>
        <p>Missing You badly DADA!</p>
